Homework 8 

1)	Bootstrap practice grid system, understand all the bootstrap class and how to write your own examples and combining them into one page, explain each class in bootstrap and provide example?
•	Grid System: allows you to add columns across the page. You can add up to 12 columns on the page, however you can group them together to create a wider space. Columns will rearrange automatically based the screen size. There are four classes to the grid system and those are extra-small for phone, small for tablets, medium for desktops, and large for larger desktops. Together these classes create pages more flexible and dynamic. For example:

<div class="row">
   <div style="border:1px solid blue;" class="col-lg-1 col-md-2 col-sm-4 col-xs-6">col-lg-1 col-md-2 col-sm-4 col-xs-6</div>
   <div style="border:1px solid blue;" class="col-lg-1 col-md-2 col-sm-4 col-xs-6">col-lg-1 col-md-2 col-sm-4 col-xs-6</div>
   <div style="border:1px solid blue;" class="col-lg-1 col-md-2 col-sm-4 col-xs-6">col-lg-1 col-md-2 col-sm-4 col-xs-6</div>
	         </div> 
	          In this example, col-lg-1 is for large screen and it occupies 1 column out of 12. 
Col-md-2 is for medium desktops and occupies 2 columns out of 12. Col-sm-4 is for small tablets and occupies 3 columns out of 12 and col-xs-6 is for extra-small phones and occupies 2 columns out of 12. 

•	Bootstrap Typography: In bootstrap HTML elements are styled a little bit differently than browser defaults. There are many bootstrap typography classes and some of those classes are .lead which makes the paragraph stands out, .text-lowercase for lowercase text, .text-right for right aligned the text, etc. For example:
<div class="container">
  <div>
   <h1>Typography</h1>
   <p>This is para 1</p>
 <p class="lead">This paragraph stands out.</p>  
</div>
In this example, h1 is styled using bootstrap styles and .lead class will make the paragraph stand out from the rest of the paragraphs. 

•	Bootstrap Tables: In the bootstrap, tables are styled with light padding with only horizontal dividers and .table class is used to style the tables. You can style with different types of classes such as .table-striped, which adds zebra-striped to table, .table-bordered, adds borders on all sides of tables and cells, .hover-table, enables hover state on the table, .table-condensed, makes table more compact by cutting cell padding in half and so on. For example:
	

	<table class="table table-condensed table table-hover table-bordered table-striped">
  	  <thead>
      	<tr>
        <th>Firstname</th>
        <th>Lastname</th>
        <th>Email</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>John</td>
        <td>Doe</td>
        <td>john@example.com</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mary</td>
        <td>Moe</td>
        <td>mary@example.com</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>July</td>
        <td>Dooley</td>
        <td>july@example.com</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
In this example, the table will be striped, condensed, bordered, and hovered. 

•	Bootstrap Images: In bootstrap, there are many different ways to shape the images. Images could be rounded, circle, or thumbnail. .img-rounded, adds round corners to an image. .img-circle, shapes the image to an circle, and .img-thumbnail, shapes images to an thumbnail. For example:
	<h2>Thumbnail</h2>
 	 <p>The .img-thumbnail class creates a thumbnail of the image:</p>
 	 <img src="cinqueterre.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Cinque Terre" width="304" height="236">
	</div>
	In this example, the image will be thumb nailed using .img-thumbnail class. 

•	Bootstrap Jumbotron: indicates a big box for calling extra attention to some special content or information, and it is displayed with grey box with rounded corners. The font sizes and text inside it will also be enlarged. For example: 



<div class="jumbotron">

   <p>This is para 1</p>
  </div>
In this example, the heading div 1 and para 1 will be in a big box for calling extra attention to some special content or information, and it is displayed with grey box with rounded corners.

•	Bootstrap Wells: The .well class will add rounded border around the element with a gray background color and some padding. There are many different sizes of wells such as small, normal and large. For example:
<h2>Well Size</h2>

  <div class="well">Normal Well</div>
  <div class="well well-lg">Large Well</div>
</div>
In this example, when the code will be executed the first well will be small, second one will be normal and then large.

<div class="alert alert-success">
    <strong>Success!</strong> This alert box could indicate a successful or positive action.
  </div>

You can also add vertical button groups, justified button group, nesting button groups and dropdown menus, and split button dropdowns. For example:
<div class="btn-group">
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">C#</button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Javascript</button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">CSS</button>

For example, if you want to move from one section to another section on the same website just do scroll over and the link will be automatically shifted from one section to another. 

•	Bootstrap Affix: If you want to make the element affixed or locked to an area on the page use affix. It is most commonly used in navigation menus or social icons buttons.
